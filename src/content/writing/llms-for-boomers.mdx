## "When I was a kid..."
...in summer of 2020, I had my first software engineering internship. I was tasked to use an LLM to try to predict events from Twitter data. 

I hadn't taken my courses yet in ML/AI, so I opened up google and searched, "LLMs for dummies." This is what I found out...

## The Road to LLMs: BERT and GPT
- In **2013**, Google researchers invented "*word embeddings*." Suddenly, computers could understand relationships between words, like ‚ÄúParis is to France what Rome is to Italy.‚Äù  
- In **2017**, another Google team published *‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need.‚Äù* This paper introduced the **Transformer**, a model architecture that used *self-attention* to read entire sentences at once instead of word by word.  
  - Example: In *‚ÄúI love rocks because they are so cool,‚Äù* the Transformer can figure out that *‚Äúthey‚Äù* refers to *rocks*.  

That breakthrough changed everything. And that was the paper I read Day 1 of my internship. 

In **2018**, two landmark models had appeared, both built on the Transformer:  
- **BERT (Google)** ‚Äì An *encoder* that learned by filling in missing words (like Mad Libs). Great at *understanding* text, not at writing it.  
- **GPT (OpenAI)** ‚Äì A *decoder* that learned by predicting the **next word**. This small design choice made it a writer, not just a reader.  

They were born the same year, from the same Transformer ‚Äúparent,‚Äù but trained with different goals. BERT became the master of *understanding*; GPT, with scale and compute, became the master of *generation*.

### Why GPT Surprised Everyone
At the time, most experts thought BERT was the future. After all, it was already powering Google Search. GPT, by contrast, looked like ‚Äújust autocomplete.‚Äù But when OpenAI scaled it up ‚Äî more data, more compute, bigger context windows ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt just parrot words back. It could **write essays, answer questions, even hold conversations**.  

To summarize:  
The Transformer unlocked the door in 2017.  
BERT and GPT walked through it together in 2018 ‚Äî but in different directions.  
One became the master of *understanding*; the other, with scale and compute, became the master of *generation*.  

At this point you must be thinking, how do computers read words in the first place?

## From Words to Tokens

## Why start with tokens?
At the heart of every LLM is a simple fact: **computers don‚Äôt understand words; they understand numbers.** Before any model can learn patterns in language, text has to be **broken into tokens** and mapped to **IDs** (numbers).  

Think of it like teaching a child to read:  
- At first, you break down sentences into letters and words.  
- Then you assign each letter a place in the alphabet.  
- Finally, you make meaning from the sequence.  

LLMs do something very similar, but they don‚Äôt use an alphabet‚Äîthey use a **vocabulary of tokens**.  

---

## Step 1: Tokenization
**Tokenization** is just a fancy word for ‚Äúchopping up text.‚Äù  

- A *na√Øve way* is splitting on spaces. That gives you words, but also problems. For example:  
  - `"Hello,"` vs `"Hello"` ‚Üí two different tokens, even though they mean the same thing.  
- A *better way* is **regex tokenization**, where you explicitly separate punctuation, words, and symbols.  
- The *modern solution* is **subword tokenization** (like GPT-2 uses). This splits words into smaller, reusable chunks.  
  - Example: *unbelievable* ‚Üí `["un", "believ", "able"]`.  
  - This way, the model never gets stuck on words it hasn‚Äôt seen before.  

üëâ **Key takeaway:** Tokenization ensures any text can be broken into manageable pieces the model knows how to handle.  

---

## Step 2: From tokens to IDs
Once text is split into tokens, each token gets assigned a **unique number (ID)**.  
- `"the"` might be `5`, `"dog"` might be `317`, and so on.  
- This is called a **vocabulary**: the lookup table that maps tokens ‚Üî IDs.  

The model doesn‚Äôt see `"dog"`. It sees `[5, 317, 92]`. Later, these IDs are turned into **embeddings**‚Äîvectors the model actually learns from.  

---

## Step 3: Making training samples
Now that we have IDs, we need to build **training examples**. LLMs learn by predicting the **next token** in a sequence.  

Imagine our text:  

```json
the quick brown fox jumps
```

- **Input (x):** `[the, quick, brown, fox]`  
- **Target (y):** `[quick, brown, fox, jumps]`  

The model sees `x` and tries to predict `y`. This simple shift is how GPT models learn to write, reason, and even code.  

---

## Step 4: Context length (T)
Models can‚Äôt look at infinite text at once‚Äîthey have a **context window**.  

- If `T=8`, the model only sees 8 tokens at a time.  
- More tokens = better understanding of context, but also more memory and compute.  
- Attention cost grows roughly like T¬≤. Double T, and the compute goes up 4√ó.  

üëâ That‚Äôs why context length is such a big deal when comparing models. 

üí° Fun Fact: ChatGPT pro version currently has a 128k token context size.
And at the time of writing this, Gemini Pro version has a context window of 1 million tokens... which means it can process up to 1,500 pages of text or 30K lines of code simultaneously.

---

## Step 5: Stride
When preparing data, we slide a window across the token stream. **Stride** is how far we move the window each time.  

- Small stride (e.g., 1) ‚Üí lots of overlap, many training examples, but more redundancy.  
- Large stride (e.g., 64) ‚Üí fewer, more unique examples.  

Stride is like setting the pace in a marching band‚Äîtight steps give more rhythm, big steps cover more ground.  

---

## Why this all matters
Everything in this chapter (and this post) is about **feeding the model the right kind of data**:  
- Text ‚Üí tokens ‚Üí IDs ‚Üí (x, y) pairs ‚Üí ready for embeddings.  

Along the way, we solved real-world problems (punctuation, OOV words, batching). Without this foundation, the Transformer architecture behind these models wouldn‚Äôt have anything to chew on.  

---

## Final Thoughts
Looking back, the early LLM days taught us that **data preparation is half the battle**. You can‚Äôt train a good model if your inputs are messy or incomplete. That‚Äôs why Chapter 2 of `Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)` from Sebastian Raschka is all about tokenization and batching‚Äîit‚Äôs the invisible plumbing that makes LLMs possible.  

In the next post (*LLMs for Boomers, Part 2*), we‚Äôll finally step into the model itself and see how embeddings and attention layers take these token IDs and turn them into language understanding through word embeddings.

‚úÖ **You now know:**  
- Who BERT and GPT really are :) 
- What tokens and vocabularies are.  
- Why subword tokenization (WordPiece & BPE) solved a major problem.  
- How context length and stride shape training data.  
- How (x, y) shifting sets up the prediction task.
