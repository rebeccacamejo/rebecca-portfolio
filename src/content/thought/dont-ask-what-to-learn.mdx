title: "Don't Ask 'What to Learn'"
description: "Don't start by asking 'what to learn.' It's the wrong approach. If you don't know where you're going, how will you know when you get there?"

Think about it:
- iOS or Android? They're just tools.
- Full stack or web dev? More tools.

The real question is – What do you want to build? What is your mission? 

I filter everything through, "Does this solve a real problem that frustrates me or someone I care about? Would this make someone's life more joyful or more productive?"

Know your filter.

Start there. Figure out what excites you. What problem do you want to solve? And why? 

Maybe it's:
- An app that helps people exercise more.
- A personal finance tool with biblical principles.
- A geology game teaching kids about rocks and minerals.

Once you know that, your choice becomes clearer.

Plus, motivation matters. Learning is hard. If you're not pumped about the end goal, you'll quit.

I've seen it happen.

People spend months or years learning certain tech because it is "hot".
Then, they hate it and give up entirely.

Don't be those people.

Pick a project you care about. The right tools will follow.

Invest in people. Solve their problems. And let everything you do and create lead them somewhere greater than where they were at before.

Remember – Tech changes fast. Your passion? That lasts.
